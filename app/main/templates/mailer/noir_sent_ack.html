		<p>Hello {{client.first_name}},</p>
		<p>We are moving to the next step of dispute for your {{debt.name}}.
		</p>
		<p>This account is still being actively disputed and you should not receive calls from this collector. If you receive ANY calls please log the call and notify me as it is a potential harassment.</p>
		<p>Don&rsquo;t forget every time we send them a letter (either through Fax or Mail) you will receive the reply from them, IF they send one.  Don&rsquo;t engage with them (either by phone or mail) and please send me the replies you receive ASAP.
		</p>
		<p>Don&rsquo;t panic if their response sounds negative or threatening. 3<sup>rd</sup> party Collection agencies commonly use stall or scare tactics at first.
		</p>
		<p>Based on their reply, I will know the next step to take for you.
